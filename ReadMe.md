## Overview

This is an animation of an ambulance driving past a person with
its siren on.  The siren is synthesized with a frequency that
varies according to the Doppler effect.

## How to Deploy

1. Create an empty directory
2. Copy the application executable and img subdirectory to that directory
3. In a command window, change to the directory
4. Run <b>C:\Qt\6.8.3\mingw_64\bin\windeployqt <i>&lt;app&gt;</i>.exe</b>

This will add the necessary dynamic link libraries and other
files to the directory to allow running the application.
